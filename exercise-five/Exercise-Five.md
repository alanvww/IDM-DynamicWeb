# Exercise Five: Users and Authentication

The purpose of this exercise is to get create users and allow users to authenticate to your site.

## Steps

1. Create a Create React App folder and push it to your Github
2. Create the components you will need (and put in some filler content):

- Components
  - Login Form
  - Create User Form
  - User Profile Components
- Pages
  - Login Page
  - Create User Form
  - User Profile Page

3. Sign up to Netlify and deploy to Netlify
4. Set up routes for your project (See exercise one for assistance)
5. Create universal header for the project
6. Hook up Firebase to your project and create new Firebase project
7. Setup Firebase Auth (https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth)
8. Setup Create Account flow
9. Setup Login Flow
10. Setup Logout Flow
11. Display User Profile information on the User Profile page.
12. Display items in header based on user's logged in/out state
13. Send user to login if logged out and user profile if logged in
14. Send a link to your Github repo and a deployed version of the app from Netlify

## Miscellaneous Notes

1. You will have to track whether a user is signed in or not
2. You will have to make sure you are querying data for a user specifically
3. Rely heavily on Firebase for handling the get user and authentication (https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/manage-users#get_a_users_profile)
