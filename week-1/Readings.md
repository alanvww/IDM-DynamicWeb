3. If you have no idea what a server is:
   "In computing, _a server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients"_... Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers...

Client–server systems are today most frequently implemented by (and often identified with) the _request–response_ model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgement."
